# RAPP Bootstrap

The canonical end-to-end playbook is [the repository's skill.md](../../skill.md).
Read it in full before acting. This entry is a router, not a separate installer
recipe or permission grant.

Resolve `../../skill.md` relative to this skill directory. The `rapp@brainstem`
plugin's repository source includes that file. If a host cannot access the local
reference, read the canonical source at:

```text
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kody-w/rapp-installer/main/skill.md
```

If neither source can be read, report that missing guidance rather than
inventing an installation procedure.
Check that the loaded document is the version 2 or later setup-and-learning
playbook. Do not silently substitute an older install-only guide.

## Required behavior

- Authoring, review, and preview are non-executing. A blanket **do not deploy
  anything now** blocks setup changes; **approved local setup, no cloud
  deployment** permits only that approved local scope. Clarify conflicting
  constraints before acting.
- Confirm that execution tools operate on the learner-approved computer, not
  the assistant's unrelated cloud workspace.
- Obtain scoped approval before installation or persistent changes. Let the
  learner complete personal sign-in, MFA, and OS consent.
- Use the supported installer/bootstrap path; never patch the Brainstem kernel,
  create an ad-hoc runtime, or discard an existing installation's data.
- Preserve the manual one-liners as a fallback, but do the technical work for a
  learner who chooses the approved AI-first path.
- On supported plugin hosts, approved `rapp@brainstem` setup includes registering
  `kody-w/RAR` and installing `rapp@rar`. Use the host's actual plugin commands
  and verify discovery after a new conversation.
- Do not stop at a healthy port. Follow the canonical baseline, memory exercise,
  bounded MVP, synthetic-data, tests-first, Brainstem feedback, rehearsal, and
  learner-understanding checkpoints.
- Establish the canonical safe-practice boundary before chat or memory tests.
  Do not query broad memories or unrestricted builder-capable instances as a
  supposedly read-only baseline.
- Report **setup-ready**, **productive-ready**, or **blocked** honestly. Cloud
  deployment, publishing, external drafts, and sending remain separate approvals.

The learner owns the goal and final judgment. The AI handles the approved work
and teaches the loop one useful result at a time.
